      <p>
        The goal of this project is to provide a interactive tool that
        facilitates the learning of the OSI model network layer for those who
        are visual learners. By applying networking terms and concepts taught
        during lectures to our project, we hoped to reinforce our learning by
        implementing these ideas into an open-ended application that allows the
        user to build and simulate their own networks. Simplified controls such
        as drag-and-drop for organizing end-systems and network links make our
        application more accessible when compared to a tool that uses a command
        line or a simple GUI. A tool with high accessibility and an easy-to-use
        interface can be used to effectively teach grade school students or
        casual learners about different networking concepts.

        Frontend: Network Node Interface
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to provide an interactive and appealing interface for our
        application, we made use of the open source <code>vis.js</code> network
        visualization tool. This tool provides an easy means of organizing
        network nodes on a blank canvas through the use of drag-and-drop
        controls. These nodes are connected by edges. The user can then create
        or delete edges between nodes using a simple edge editor toolbar at the
        top left of the screen. <code>vis.js</code> on its own does not provide
        network emulation capabilities, so we had to use a different tool for
        such simulations.
      </p>

        Backend: Network Emulation
      </h2>
      <p>
        The networking layer of the OSI model is a multifaceted ordeal. One must
        take several factors into consideration to ensure that packets are
        promptly delivered to the intended recipient without issues. These
        factors include, but are not limited to, network delays, packet loss and
        bandwidth limitations. By using the open source tool Kathara, we may
        simulate these factors in a sandbox environment. Kathara allows the user
        to create and run simulated devices. These devices may then communicate
        with other simulated devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The node and edge structures created by the user through
        <code>vis.js</code> can then be converted into a network of Kathara
        devices before starting a simulation. The purpose of such a simulation
        would be to test the ruggedness of the user's design under adverse
        conditions. We may then design simple levels that ask the user to reach
        certain goals such as a reaching target throughput or ensuring that a
        network packet reaches the proper recipient by following correct router
        links.
      </p>
      <h2 class="writeup_header" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By combining the interactive capabilities of <code>vis.js</code> and the
        emulation capabilities of Kathara, we are able to create an application
        that allows for an accessible means of organizing and running simulated
        Kathara devices. This opens up networking concepts to those who prefer
        learning with a visual aid, or those who would like to design and test
        their own networks without much hassle or command line usage.
