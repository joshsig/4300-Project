    <p>
      This projects goals was to teach students like ourselves to understand
      network topographies. In our development we learned lots about network
      topography. This is a challenging field when first learning about computer
      networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project also utilized our learning about programming on networks, the
      simulation of networks, and the visualization of networks. We learned how
      to use the <code>networkx library?</code> in python to create and
      visualize networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <code>vis.js</code> we were able to visualize the network
      topography. This was a great tool to help us understand the network
      topography. We were able to see the nodes and edges of the network. This
      helped us understand the network topography and how the nodes and edges
      interacted with each other.
