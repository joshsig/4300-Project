# COMP 4300 - TopogChamp Writeup

This projects goals was to teach students like ourselves to understand network topographies. In our development we learned lots about network topography.  This is a challenging field when first learning about computer networks. 

This  project also utilized our learning about programming on networks, the simulation of networks, and the visualization of networks. We learned how to use the networkx library in python to create and visualize networks.

Using `vis.js` we were able to visualize the network topography. This was a great tool to help us understand the network topography. We were able to see the nodes and edges of the network. This helped us understand the network topography and how the nodes and edges interacted with each other.
